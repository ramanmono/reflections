What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds the git metadata in the .git directory.
This is so you can add files to track and commit changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

working directory has all the files,
but in the staging area you only add files you want to commit.
The repository contains every commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Use git status to see what files are stages.
Unstage onces that are not logical for that change.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

For experimental changes that you are not sure will workout
and for changes that change behaviour in a way that is drastically different.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

That is what a diagram does. Helps visualising data.
In this case the commits in each branch and how they are related.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
