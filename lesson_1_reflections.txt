How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I looked where there is a - and + sign right next to each other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It gives a better grand view.
    And you will be able to discover errors that were not in older versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros are that changes can be logical, but the cons are that you can forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because with programing a single logical change can be spread in different files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git bog gives all the versions with a unique id. You can then use git diff
    and those id's to compare them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you add code that could crash,
    you can always go to a previous version without the error

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use it for my android development projects.
